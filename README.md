# Scripts

Open-sourced, free-to-use scripts for use with the [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) plugin.

## Goal

The main goal with this repository is to include a collection of scripts that can easily be utilized, modified, and expanded upon to make it easier to develop and grow a Minecraft server. The scripts in this repository should be as straight forward and simple as possible, and the focus should be on vanilla Skript rather than add-ons.

## Guidelines

1. The scripts should be neat and readable, I'm not going to accept any changes if it's inefficient or messy. Anything included in this repository should be at a level where I would be comfortable showcasing it to others as a way to learn Skript. If you aren't fully confident in whether your script is at that level, you should try asking for feedback from others before submitting it here.

2. The use of addons should be limited as a need basis and a script shouldn't be using add-ons if it doesn't fully need it. I don't want to start adding scripts that have dozens of add-ons when it could easily be accomplished with much less. The focus of this repository is on scripts that could be used in vanilla Skript so I would like to limit the use of addons to only scripts that need it to function.

3. Anything uploaded to this repository should have a limited amount of unnecessary bulk or annoyances. Including credits in the script is fine, but broadcasting it to the whole server is not. The main point here is the script needs to be quite straight forward and we don't need to include anything insanely unneeded, it needs to be easy for developers to expand upon and shape it for their own use.
